Similarity Search Techniques in Vector Databases

Similarity search is the core operation in vector databases, enabling the retrieval of vectors that are most similar to a given query vector. Understanding different similarity metrics and search algorithms is crucial for optimizing vector database performance.

Distance Metrics:

1. Cosine Similarity
   - Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors
   - Range: -1 to 1 (1 being most similar)
   - Best for: Text and normalized embeddings
   - Formula: cos(θ) = (A·B) / (||A|| × ||B||)

2. Euclidean Distance
   - Straight-line distance between two points
   - Range: 0 to infinity (0 being most similar)
   - Best for: Computer vision and spatial data
   - Formula: d = √Σ(ai - bi)²

3. Manhattan Distance (L1)
   - Sum of absolute differences between coordinates
   - Range: 0 to infinity
   - Best for: Sparse data and feature selection
   - Formula: d = Σ|ai - bi|

4. Dot Product
   - Simple multiplication and sum of vector components
   - Best for: Fast approximate searches
   - Formula: A·B = Σ(ai × bi)

Search Algorithms:

1. Exact Search
   - Brute force comparison with all vectors
   - Guaranteed accuracy but slow for large datasets
   - Time complexity: O(n)

2. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)
   - Trade accuracy for speed
   - Various algorithms: LSH, NSW, HNSW
   - Time complexity: O(log n) typically

3. Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)
   - Multi-layer graph structure
   - Excellent performance for high-dimensional data
   - Used by many modern vector databases

4. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
   - Hash similar vectors to same buckets
   - Good for very high-dimensional sparse data
   - Probabilistic guarantees

Optimization Techniques:

1. Indexing Strategies
   - Choose appropriate index type for your data
   - Consider memory vs. accuracy trade-offs
   - Regular index maintenance and optimization

2. Query Optimization
   - Batch similar queries together
   - Use appropriate similarity thresholds
   - Implement result caching for frequent queries

3. Hardware Considerations
   - GPU acceleration for large-scale searches
   - Memory mapping for large datasets
   - SSD storage for better I/O performance

4. Hybrid Approaches
   - Combine exact and approximate methods
   - Multi-stage filtering (coarse then fine)
   - Parallel processing across multiple cores

Production Considerations:
- Monitor search latency and throughput
- Implement circuit breakers for failed searches
- Plan for index updates and maintenance windows
- Consider data partitioning strategies for scale
