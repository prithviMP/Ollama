- Basic understanding of linear algebra and similarity metrics
- Familiarity with database concepts

### Setup
```bash
cd lesson-06-vector-stores
poetry install && poetry shell
cp env.example .env
python main.py
```

## üìù Code Examples

### Basic Vector Store Setup
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create vector store
vectorstore = Chroma(
    collection_name="documents",
    embedding_function=embeddings,
    persist_directory="./chroma_db"
)

# Add documents
documents = ["Document content here...", "More content..."]
vectorstore.add_texts(documents)
```

### Similarity Search with Metadata
```python
# Search with metadata filtering
results = vectorstore.similarity_search(
    query="machine learning concepts",
    k=5,
    filter={"source": "textbook", "chapter": "neural_networks"}
)

# Search with scores
results_with_scores = vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(
    query="python programming",
    k=3
)
```

### Custom Embedding Pipeline
```python
class CustomEmbeddingPipeline:
    def __init__(self, embedding_model, chunk_size=1000):
        self.embeddings = embedding_model
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size
        self.vectorstore = None
    
    def process_and_store(self, documents):
        # Split, embed, and store documents
        chunks = self._split_documents(documents)
        self.vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
            documents=chunks,
            embedding=self.embeddings
        )
    
    def semantic_search(self, query, filters=None):
        return self.vectorstore.similarity_search(
            query=query,
            filter=filters
        )
```
