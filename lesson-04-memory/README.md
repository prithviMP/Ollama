## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Completed Lessons 1-3 (Basic Prompting, Prompt Engineering, Chains)
- Understanding of LLM context windows and token limits
- Basic knowledge of vector embeddings

### Setup
```bash
cd lesson-04-memory
poetry install && poetry shell
cp env.example .env  # Configure your API keys
python main.py
```

## üìù Code Examples

### Conversation Buffer Memory
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)

# Persistent conversation context
response = conversation.predict(input="Hi, I'm learning about AI")
response = conversation.predict(input="What did I just say I was learning about?")
```

### Vector Store Memory
```python
from langchain.memory import VectorStoreRetrieverMemory
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

vectorstore = Chroma(embedding_function=embeddings)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs=dict(k=1))

memory = VectorStoreRetrieverMemory(retriever=retriever)
memory.save_context({"input": "favorite color"}, {"output": "blue"})

# Later retrieval
relevant_docs = memory.load_memory_variables({"prompt": "color preference"})
```

### Custom Memory Implementation
```python
from langchain.memory.chat_memory import BaseChatMemory
from langchain.schema import BaseMessage

class CustomBusinessMemory(BaseChatMemory):
    def __init__(self, user_id: str):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.business_context = {}
    
    def save_context(self, inputs, outputs):
        # Custom business logic for saving
        pass
    
    def load_memory_variables(self, inputs):
        # Custom retrieval logic
        return {"history": self.business_context}
```

## üèãÔ∏è Exercises

### Exercise 1: Multi-User Chat System
Build a conversation system that maintains separate memory for multiple users.

### Exercise 2: Long-Term Memory Assistant
Create an AI assistant that remembers user preferences across sessions.

### Exercise 3: Context-Aware Customer Support
Implement a support bot that maintains conversation history and escalation context.

### Exercise 4: Memory-Optimized Chatbot
Design a chatbot that efficiently manages memory for long conversations.

### Exercise 5: Business Process Memory
Build a system that remembers complex business workflows and user decisions.

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Memory Types**: Choose the right memory type for your use case and constraints
2. **Token Management**: Balance context retention with token cost optimization
3. **Persistence**: Implement proper session management for production applications
4. **Scalability**: Design memory systems that scale with user base and data volume
5. **User Experience**: Memory enhances conversation quality and personalization
