# LangChain Comprehensive Course - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive 9-hour LangChain course with hands-on Python coding examples, structured as individual lessons in separate folders. The course will be uploaded to GitHub for public access and learning.

## Target Audience
- Python developers wanting to learn LangChain
- AI/ML engineers looking to understand LLM application development
- Students and professionals interested in building AI applications
- Developers wanting to implement RAG systems and AI agents

## Course Structure Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry
- **Environment**: .env files for configuration
- **Structure**: Each lesson in separate folder
- **Duration**: 9 hours total content

#### Lesson 9: Production, Callbacks, and Advanced Patterns (1 hour)
- Callback handlers
- Streaming responses
- Error handling and monitoring
- Deployment considerations
- Performance optimization

## Deliverables

### Each Lesson Folder Should Contain:
1. **README.md** - Lesson objectives and overview
2. **main.py** - Primary lesson code
3. **pyproject.toml** - Poetry configuration
4. **requirements.txt** - Alternative pip requirements
5. **.env.example** - Environment template
6. **exercises.py** - Practice exercises
7. **solutions.py** - Exercise solutions
8. **assets/** - Any additional files (PDFs, data, etc.)

## Success Criteria
1. Each lesson can be run independently
2. Progressive difficulty with clear learning objectives
3. Practical, real-world examples
4. Proper error handling and documentation
5. GitHub-ready with proper README files
6. All dependencies properly managed with Poetry
7. Environment configuration clearly documented

## Constraints
