# Document Processing with LangChain

This is a sample document to demonstrate document processing capabilities.

## Introduction
Document processing is a crucial part of building RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems. 
LangChain provides various document loaders and text splitters to handle different file formats.

## Key Concepts
1. Document Loaders: Extract text from various file formats
2. Text Splitters: Break down large documents into manageable chunks
3. Document Transformers: Clean and enrich document content
4. Processing Pipelines: Automate the entire document processing workflow

## Best Practices
- Choose appropriate chunk sizes based on your use case
- Maintain semantic coherence when splitting documents
- Add metadata to improve retrieval accuracy
- Validate document quality before processing
